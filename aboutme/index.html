   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <h2>Jennifer Heiner</h2>
   <h2>Nicknames: Jenn-e,  Willow or Jen</h2>
   <p>I currently reside in Spanish Fork, Utah.  We moved here for my husband to get the recovery support he needed right now.  He is a medically retired TBI injured military Vetaran.  I have six amazing children I care for and an ailing father as well. I am going to school for my Bachelors in Business Management and hope to obtain that in a year and a half. I wanted to learn about web fundamentals and programming, which is why i chose this as an elective. I feel its important in the business world to be able to speak the language and at least understand basics of some of the people you are working with, no matter what your position is. I used to be a small business owner and Cosmetologist. We moved around quite a bit with the military so I was difficult to keep my business open. My husband is a northerner and I am as southerner and cannot wait to get back to my beautiful southern states when he is more recovered. </p>
