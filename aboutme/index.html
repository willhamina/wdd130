    <h2>Jen</h2>
    <p>My name is Jennifer, but most people call me Jen. I am currently working on getting my Bachelors in Applied Business Management with an emphasis on web fundamentals.</p>
    <p> I Ive been maried for 16 years and have six amazing children. I was a single mother of three of them for a long time and was a Cosmetologist prior to support them.</p>
    <p> I have enjoyed being able to draw closer to Hevenly Father in going to BYUI and am grateful for the opportunity to continue my education.</p>
    <p> I want my children to know that they can overcome many things and continue to learn and grow with Heavenly Father at thier side. I am grateful for the time I have left on this earth and hope I will get to see some of my future generations enjoying thier journey as well! </p>
